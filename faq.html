          <div class="st-content">
            <p>Introduction of addressable systems requires large investments in equipment such as Headend, encryption, Subscriber management system and set top boxes. This level of investment cannot be done by the local cable operator. Hence an MSO sets the platform to receive signals from the broadcasters, adapts it to provide for addressability, keeps the consumer database, ensures compliance of quality of service and other regulations of TRAI and through Local cable operators or in some cases directly provides channels to subscribers. Thus the local cable operator is supposed to enter into an agreement with one of the permitted MSOs.(As per TRAI guidelines)</p>
